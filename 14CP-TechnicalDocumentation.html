        <header>What is technical Documentation & Why is it important to review examples of technical documents?
             
        </header>
        <div class="box1"> Technical documents describe the framework, functionality, or purpose of a product, service, or system. From persuasive content to educative articles, there are a wide variety of technical documents you may write.
             Reviewing examples of technical documents can help you decide on a suitable type to create for your specific situation. 
             In this article, we explore why it is important to review technical document examples, discover tips for creating technical documents, and present 15 technical document examples.
             
             Reviewing examples of technical documents is important because they can help learn how to communicate complex information to others. They're common in software, medicine, and manufacturing. These documents may describe a product's development process or relate to products in their finished state. 
             Regardless of the field, it's typically the responsibility of a technical writer to create these documents.
